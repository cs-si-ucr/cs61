1. Why would we need a multiplexer before the left arm of the ALU (SR2BUS, SR2MUX)?
What two things are we choosing between?

1. When are the condition codes set?

1. Why would we use a flag bit in the ADD instruction instead of just creating two separate instructions?
(One to perform addition of two registers and one to add a register and an immediate value)

1. Where does the select signal for SR2MUX come from?

1. Why do we need a ready signal from memory?

1. What is the purpose of the FSM in the LC-3?

1. Why is it acceptable for the ALU to perform all operations at once (ADD, AND, NOT..), even when the desired instruction is ADD?

1. How do we manage / control access to the LC-3 Reg. Bank?

1. `ADD R1, R4, #-2`<br>
When this instruction is executed, what is on the SR2bus? (What is the SR2bus?)

1. Assemble this instruction:<br>
`x3010           LEA R6, label`<br>
`x3045  label    .FILL #6`
