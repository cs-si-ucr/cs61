Welcome to CS61 SI!
===================
This is where all of the labs will be posted.

What is SI?
-----------
Supplemental Instruction is a series of weekly review sessions for students taking historically difficult courses.
It offers students the chance to collaborate, discuss challenging concepts, and study for exams.

What isn’t SI?
--------------
Supplemental Instruction is not a lecture.
SI Leaders are not there to teach you new material but to lead you in reviewing the material covered in lecture and to help guide you in understanding the subject.

Who should go?
--------------
If you are in a Learning Community, attendance is mandatory.

Guidelines:
-----------
1. Be respectful. This includes silencing your cell phones and not using them during sessions.
2. Participate! You won’t get very much out of SI if you don’t.
3. No food or drink besides water. This is a rule placed by the administration. I will enforce it.
4. Late entry and early exit should be quiet.
5. Sign in, even if you are late.
