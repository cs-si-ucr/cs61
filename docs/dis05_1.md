Detour Sign
---

In lecture, we discussed one possible method of creating a finite state machine for a detour sign.
We are going to expand on this.

Instead of wrapping around from fully-lit to the all off state, the sign should reverse lighting direction until all lights are off.
(see explanation on board)

1. Draw the FSM
1. Determine the truth table for the FSM
