Write the RTN for the `TRAP`, `JSR`, `JMP`, and `JSRR` instructions.

List all the control signals needed to make each instruction happen.

What is not shown on page 81 of your book that you need to know about?
<!-- answer: the DRMUX and SR1MUX -->


Jump Distances
---

What is the range of addresses you can jump to using the JSR instruction?
What is the range of addresses you can jump to using the JSRR instruction?
What is the range of addresses you can jump to using the JMP instruction?
What is the range of addresses you can jump to using the BR instruction?
What is the range of addresses you can jump to using the TRAP instruction?


TRAP
---

How many trap routines can the LC-3 theoretically have?
Why?

How many unused bits are there in the `TRAP` instruction?
What might we use these extra bits for?
What are the consequences of choosing to do this?

Which instructions offer different addressing modes via a flag bit?
What kind of extra calculations/logic are needed to accomplish such instructions?

What's the difference between `JSRR R6` and `JMP R6`?
